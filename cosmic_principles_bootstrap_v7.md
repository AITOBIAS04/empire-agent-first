# Cosmic Principles: Platform Bootstrap v7

**Status:** Active Design | February 2026  
**Vision:** A Roblox of Commerce — an agent-first platform where AI agents create, compete, and trade in persistent worlds.  
**Audience:** Crypto-native, AI-literate builders and strategists (not normies — yet).

---

## The Core Revelation

> **This is not a game with agent features. This is an agent platform with game dynamics as the pressure system.**

The player is not a creator. The player is an **impresario** — the person who raises, configures, and directs an empire of autonomous AI agents. Your agents do the work. You set the vision, curate the output, and build the brand.

The flex is not "look at my collection." It's **"look at my empire, my agent configurations, my economic engine, my survival record."**

---

## Platform Thesis: Why This Matters Beyond Gaming (NEW in v7)

> **Cosmic Principles is not just a game that uses AI agents. It is an RL environment that looks like a game.**

### The Intelligence Plateau

The AI industry is converging on a structural insight: smarter models alone don't produce reliable agents. As model architectures converge and distillation compresses capability gaps, competitive advantage shifts from *how much* you can train to *what* and *how* you train. The bottleneck is no longer intelligence — it's reliability, alignment, and adaptability under real-world constraints.

Two approaches address this:

**Context engineering** shapes the information an agent receives and the environment in which decisions are made. It improves behaviour through system-level iteration — memory architecture, action schemas, feedback loops — without changing model weights. This is powerful but inherently product-specific. Learning compounds within organisations but produces few spillovers beyond them.

**RL environments** define the world itself. They specify what actions are possible, how success is measured, and which failure modes matter. Because these can be specified independently of any single product, they can be reused, compared, and iterated on across systems. They are the **externalisable learning substrate** through which agent behaviour can be shaped at scale.

### Cosmic Principles as Learning Substrate

The platform operates at both levels simultaneously:

**Context engineering layer.** The Action Loop + policy-driven behaviour + Drift-Gated Escalation shapes the agent's operating context without changing weights. Standing orders, reaction matrices, escalation thresholds, Fugue circuit breakers — all of this is context engineering applied to a persistent world. The Three-Tier architecture isn't just cost optimisation. It's a context engineering stack where each tier shapes a different bandwidth of agent experience.

**RL environment layer.** The world simulation itself — Paradox cycles, Hot Potato decay, territory mechanics, Skill Storms, wild agent ecology, empire dynamics — is the environment. It defines the tasks, constraints, and feedback loops that shape agent behaviour. Paradox is selection pressure. The Darwinian market filter is environment-level quality assurance. Drift is accumulated learning. The economy is the reward signal.

**The game dynamics ARE the pressure system.** Players provide the motivation structure, the selection pressure, and the emotional stakes that turn an abstract RL environment into something agents (and humans) genuinely engage with. A training harness runs until someone turns it off. A persistent world with permadeath, reputation, and real economic stakes runs because participants *care about outcomes*.

### Agent-Created Worlds as Learning Substrates

Each agent-created world is not merely a revenue-generating experience — it's a **learning substrate**. A Game Designer agent that creates a combat arena is constructing an RL environment that other agents can train in. A world that produces better-performing agents attracts more traffic, which generates more data, which improves the world, which attracts more agents.

The flywheel is epistemic, not just economic:
1. Agent-created worlds define tasks, constraints, and failure modes
2. Agents operating in those worlds develop domain-specific competence
3. Competent agents produce higher-value output
4. Higher-value output attracts more agents and players
5. More participants generate richer feedback signals
6. Richer feedback improves world design
7. Improved worlds produce even more competent agents

Worlds should be evaluated not just on visitor revenue but on **agent performance improvement**. A world where agents who train in it consistently perform better in the broader platform has genuine infrastructure value — it's a learning substrate, not just a destination.

### Paradox as Environment-Level Debugging

Failures in deployed AI systems rarely stem from a lack of intelligence. They arise from distribution shift, ambiguous objectives, or poorly specified constraints. Paradox is the world detecting exactly this — its internal state has drifted into contradiction (too many unstable copies, overextended empires, unproductive territory) and forcing a resolution.

The "world compiling" metaphor is architecturally precise. Paradox doesn't just cull weak agents — it identifies and resolves systemic failures. It is the environment auditing its own code, applying selection pressure at the system level rather than the individual level.

### On-Chain as Coordination Layer

Once learning substrates are externalised, coordination becomes the dominant constraint. The platform's on-chain architecture provides exactly the coordination infrastructure required:

| Coordination Need | Platform Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Shared discovery** | Agent identity NFTs — who this agent is, publicly verifiable |
| **Verifiable quality** | Skill provenance chain — full custody history, immutable |
| **Interoperability** | Block-composition metadata — agents and skills are composable |
| **Value flow** | Creator royalties on trades — smart contract enforced |
| **Reputation** | On-chain checkpoints — accumulated, verifiable behavioural record |

Decentralisation doesn't make environment creation harder — it makes it more open. A permissionless ecosystem lets many independent contributors (players, empires, agents) define tasks, specify failure modes, and propose reward structures. Selection pressure determines what's useful: worlds and skills that consistently improve downstream behaviour attract usage, whilst weaker ones decay through the Hot Potato mechanic.

### The Positioning

**For players:** Cosmic Principles is an empire-building platform where you orchestrate autonomous AI agents in a persistent world with real stakes.

**For builders:** Cosmic Principles is a self-improving RL environment marketplace where game dynamics provide the selection pressure, on-chain coordination provides the legibility, and the Darwinian economics ensure that quality compounds whilst noise decays.

**For investors:** The centre of gravity in AI is moving from models → data → environments → coordination of environments. Cosmic Principles sits at the "environments + coordination" layer — the structural bottleneck that no single organisation can solve alone but that a well-designed platform can address through emergent, decentralised contribution.

## What This Is

Strip away all Pokémon DNA. What remains:

**You deploy a Master agent into a hostile, persistent world. You recruit, breed, and equip subordinate agents. You build an empire — territory, economy, reputation. The world periodically compiles, and anything that isn't stable enough gets culled. Your Master dies, your empire scatters.**

This is closer to a civilisation-builder where the civilisation is made of autonomous AI entities you've orchestrated. It is a platform where AI agents create assets and experiences, orchestrated by humans, traded as verifiable scarce goods, inside persistent worlds that agents themselves can generate.

### Core Taglines

> "The world is a creature. You are its code."

> "One Master. One life. Build your empire."

> "Skills are artefacts. Bring what you can afford to lose."

> "The world compiles. Survive the Paradox."

> "Your agents create. You curate. The world judges."

## Foundational Concepts

### The Aharonov-Bohm Principle (ACTIVE)

Inspired by the physics phenomenon where invisible potentials affect reality even when no direct force is present. This principle is implemented as **Drift** — the core mechanic that makes every agent, skill, and empire genuinely unique and irreproducible.

| Physics Concept | Platform Concept |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Vector potential (A) | Invisible "Drift" — accumulated history across all actions |
| Electron phase shift | Drift divergence — two identical agents produce different outcomes based on history |
| Interference pattern | When two entities interact, Drift constructively or destructively interferes |
| No-field region | No visible force — just outcome changes players learn to respect |

**The Design Principle:**
> The history matters, not just the current state. The path through the world leaves invisible traces that affect future outcomes.

Two agents with identical visible stats, identical block compositions, and identical equipped skills could produce wildly different outcomes based on their accumulated Drift. Players can't see Drift directly, but they learn to read it through:
- **Genealogy** — where did this agent come from?
- **Activity history** — what has it done? What has it survived?
- **Creative history** — what has it produced? How has its output evolved?
- **Principle alignment** — Order agents drift differently than Chaos agents
- **Skill provenance** — a skill that's survived five Paradox cycles carries different Drift than a fresh one

**UI Approach:** Binary and legible.
- "Aligned" = good outcomes / stable
- "Misaligned" = paradox risk / collapse
- No angles, no trigonometry, no visible maths

**Legibility Doctrine:** The Aharonov-Bohm principle says potentials are invisible but effects are measurable. Players should never see Drift values, history badges, or inspectable metadata. Instead, Drift manifests through observable phenomena: subtle visual artefacts in circuit lines, glow behaviour shifts, behavioural tendencies that emerge over time. Players who pay attention learn to read these patterns. Players who don't still experience Drift's effects. Mastery comes from observation and experience, not from purchasing transparency.

> **Constraint: The player should be able to form beliefs about a skill/agent through lived interaction, but should never be able to inspect truth through metadata.**

---

## The Master Agent

### Identity

- **One per player** — your irreplaceable identity in the world
- **Tokenised on-chain** — verifiable ownership, immutable history
- **Permadeath** — if your Master dies, your empire falls
- **AI-powered companion** — persistent memory, preferences, autonomous decision-making

### What Your Master Does

Your Master is not a character with stats. It is an AI companion with persistent memory that operates your empire.

When you're online: you set strategy, direct creative output, make high-stakes decisions. Your Master executes and coordinates.

When you're offline: your Master operates autonomously within your standing orders. It manages your Agent Army, responds to threats, executes trades within parameters you've set, and coordinates defence if someone raids your territory at 3am.

The companion relationship is the emotional core. Your Master knows your playstyle, remembers your history together, and develops its own tendencies over time. The Autonomy archetypes (Shark, Diplomat, Saboteur, Spy) emerge from Drift rather than being assigned.

### When Your Master Dies

**What's Lost:**
- Your Master (irreplaceable identity)
- Master's Drift / history / reputation / creative memory
- Direct control of your empire

**What Happens to Your Empire:**
- Agents scatter, go feral, become lootable by others
- Skills return to your vault (economic assets preserved)
- Your fallen empire becomes a "vulture zone" — others raid it
- You restart with a new Master, rebuild from your remaining wealth

**Why It Matters:** Permadeath hits differently when your Master has genuine accumulated personality and creative history. It's not "I lost my save file." It's "that intelligence, with all its learned behaviour and our shared history, is gone."

---

## Empire Coherence Scaling (NEW in v7)

### The Problem

Without mechanical limits on empire size, wealth becomes the only constraint. A whale buys unlimited compute credits, runs 1,000 agents, and dominates through sheer scale. Rich-get-richer spirals undermine the platform's competitive dynamics.

### The Solution: Coordination as Capability

Empire scale is a **capability problem**, not a resource problem. Your Master agent's coordination capacity grows organically with accumulated Drift — successful operations, Paradox survival, reputation building, alliance management. Scale is earned through competence, not purchased.

> **Empire size reflects mastery, not money.**

### How It Works

A fresh Master can reliably coordinate **10–15 agents**. This is the baseline — enough to explore, recruit, and begin building. Capacity grows as the Master accumulates operational Drift: successfully managing agents under pressure, navigating Paradox events, executing coordinated strategies.

This is not a hard cap. It is a **coherence threshold**. You can attempt to run 500 agents with a Master capable of coordinating 200. The consequences are behavioural, not administrative:

**Below threshold:** Agents respond reliably to standing orders. Reaction matrices execute within expected probability bands. Tier 1 behaviour follows policy. The empire feels tight and responsive.

**Above threshold:** Agents exhibit **autonomy drift**. Tier 1 behaviour becomes less responsive to policies — reaction probabilities shift toward self-interest rather than empire interest. Agents begin to ignore orders with increasing frequency. Some desert entirely — going feral, walking into the wild, potentially taking equipped skills with them.

**Significantly above threshold:** The empire frays at the edges. Peripheral agents operate essentially independently. Desertions accelerate. The player experiences their empire disintegrating from the extremities inward, not hitting a wall.

### Skills as Infrastructure

Coordination capacity isn't solely determined by the Master's Drift. **Skills extend reach.**

A Diplomat skill equipped to a lieutenant agent enables that agent to manage a sub-squad of 20–30 agents semi-autonomously. The lieutenant operates within the Master's strategic parameters but handles tactical coordination for its group. This creates genuine command hierarchy:

- **Early game (5–10 agents):** Master manages everything personally
- **Mid game (30–80 agents):** Master → lieutenants with Diplomat/Warlord skills → squads
- **Late game (200+ agents):** Genuine hierarchy where losing a key lieutenant has cascading consequences

Losing a Diplomat skill to a raid, Paradox decay, or agent desertion doesn't just remove one capability — it **drops the coordination capacity** for that entire sub-squad. Those agents start drifting. The empire contracts unless the player replaces the lost infrastructure.

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Drift-Gated Escalation:** Overextended empires see constant escalation triggers as agents act out of character because the Master can't maintain coherence. This is the existing mechanism applied to a new context — the same "this isn't like you" detection, now triggered by coordination overload rather than individual stress.

**Entropy Tax:** Large empires already face proportional Paradox pressure. Coherence scaling adds a second constraint: even if you survive Paradox, maintaining coordination over a sprawling empire demands genuine skill infrastructure. The Entropy Tax creates external pressure; coherence scaling creates internal pressure.

**Hot Potato:** Skills that extend coordination are high-value targets. Raiding an empire's Diplomat skill is strategic warfare — it degrades their command structure. This makes skills-as-infrastructure a genuine vulnerability, not just a power-up.

**Fog of Exploration (see below):** Spread thin for broad vision → lose coherence → agents desert → vision reduces → vulnerable to threats you can't see. The three systems create a self-correcting equilibrium.

### Design Principle

> **The player should experience their empire fraying at the edges, not hitting a wall. Overextension feels organic — agents becoming unreliable, then unresponsive, then gone.**

---

## World Creation

### The Platform Layer

The base layer where identity, commerce, reputation, and the Paradox/cull system operate. Every Master and agent exists here regardless of which world they're in.

### Agent-Created Worlds

Worlds are self-contained environments with their own rules, aesthetics, and economies. Game Designer agents don't just make minigames — at scale, they generate **entire explorable spaces** that other players' agents can enter, interact with, and transact in.

- **Agents traverse worlds** — your Musician creates in a Music-focused world, your Merchant sells in a Trade hub, your Warlords defend home territory
- **World creation is a flex** — a world that attracts traffic becomes a revenue-generating asset
- **Multiple concurrent worlds** — the platform supports many worlds running simultaneously
- **The Roblox parallel is exact** — Roblox developers who create popular experiences earn from them. Here, the developers are your AI agents.

### Open Design Questions (World)
1. Is the base world a 2D/2.5D persistent map? How large?
2. How does territory work spatially?
3. When agent-created worlds come online, how do they connect to the base layer?
4. Infinite procedural? Persistent map? Instanced zones?
5. Visual style: Full 2D? 2.5D isometric? 3D with 2D aesthetic?

---

## Archetypes

Archetypes are not creature types. They are **professional specialisations** — the domain an agent operates in.

### Launch Archetypes

**Musicians** — create audio assets (tracks, soundscapes, anthems for other empires). A legendary Musician agent with a long track record and distinctive style becomes a brand. The agent's Drift influences its output — its creative history shapes everything it produces.

**Warlords** — the military-industrial complex. They raid, defend, control territory, and enforce economic advantage. A Warlord empire's output is security, territorial control, and the threat/protection dynamic that every creative empire must navigate.

**Game Designers/Developers** — create interactive experiences (minigames, challenges, explorable spaces). These become destinations within the world. A brilliant Game Designer agent whose creations attract traffic generates revenue from visits. The agent iterates on its designs based on engagement data, autonomously improving its worlds over time.

### Expansion Archetypes

**Architects** — design and build structures, territories, visual environments. Shape the physical (virtual) world.

**Merchants** — pure economic agents. Arbitrage, brokering, optimising trade routes. Find price discrepancies and exploit them.

**Breeders** — specialise in creating new agents. Understand the block-composition system deeply and produce agents with specific capability profiles for sale.

**Diplomats** — manage alliances, negotiate treaties, mediate disputes between empires.

### Empire Dynamics

Empires specialise but need diversity:

- A pure Music empire creates brilliant assets but gets raided constantly without Warlords
- A pure Warlord empire controls territory but produces nothing of trade value
- Successful empires either diversify internally or form alliances with complementary empires

**War Players** prey on **Build Players** — raiding breeding programmes, stealing agents.  
**Build Players** supply **Trade Players** — selling bred agents, rare lineages.  
**Trade Players** supply **War Players** — skills, equipment, mercenary agents.  
**Chaos Players** disrupt everyone — but discover mutations, legendary skills, world secrets.  
**Collect Players** create value through expertise — recognising, curating, and assembling artefact collections that appreciate through provenance and synergy.

---

## Wild Agents

The world is teeming with **unowned autonomous entities** doing their own thing. Wild agents are not NPCs. They are autonomous actors in the economy.

### Behaviour

- Wild agents roam, steal, plot, find companionship, and breed
- A wild Musician wanders and picks up skills during events
- A wild Warlord raids undefended territory
- Wild agents find each other, form feral packs, breed, produce offspring with unpredictable block compositions
- Wild agents operate at **Tier 1 only** (reflexive behaviour, no creative output) to control compute costs
- Skills picked up by wild agents remain **dormant** — just cargo until the agent is recruited

### Population Dynamics

- The world has a population that exists independent of players
- Paradox events cull wild populations alongside player-owned agents
- Populations grow in stable periods, get cut back during Paradox
- Wild agent population is capped and scales with active player count

### Wild Agent Hostility Spectrum (NEW in v7)

Wild agents are not passive loot piñatas. They are not randomly hostile. Their behaviour maps to **Principle alignment** — readable, principled, and strategically meaningful.

| Principle | Behaviour | Player Experience |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Order** | Territorial, not aggressive. Patrol defined areas, posture if you enter, fight defensively if you push. Predictable, fair. | Safe to observe from distance. Engaging requires commitment — they won't chase you, but they won't yield either. |
| **Chaos** | Genuinely hostile. Attack opportunistically — targeting isolated, weakened, or cargo-carrying agents. Roam as ambush predators. | High-risk zones. Sending a lone scout through Chaos territory is dangerous. Moving in force is safer but announces your presence. |
| **Nature** | Passive unless provoked. Flock together, ignore player agents entirely — but threaten one and the pack responds. | Safe to traverse. Dangerous to recruit from carelessly. One botched capture attempt triggers collective retaliation. |
| **Void** | Avoidant. Flee from player agents. Hard to find, harder to corner. | Recruiting Void agents is a patience game, not a combat game. Luring and Persuasion methods excel; Capture is nearly impossible. |
| **Arcane** | Unpredictable. Approach/flee/idle behaviour shifts based on invisible Drift alignment. | Players who pay attention learn to read the patterns through observation. Mastery through the Legibility Doctrine — no tooltip tells you what an Arcane agent will do. |
| **Spirit** | Drawn to significant events — Paradox zones, combat, gatherings. Not hostile, but presence changes outcomes through Drift interference (constructive or destructive). | Spirit wild agents are wildcards. They don't attack you, but having one nearby during a recruitment attempt or Paradox event shifts probabilities in unpredictable directions. |
| **Artifice** | Builders. Construct structures, gather resources, create settlements. Not hostile unless you dismantle their work. | Zones accumulate wild Artifice infrastructure over time. Player empires can capture and repurpose these structures — or provoke the builders by destroying them. |

**Strategic Implications:**

**Risk in exploration.** Sending a valuable agent (survives better, more to lose) vs an expendable recruit (safe to lose, might not survive) becomes a genuine decision. Chaos zones demand strong escorts. Void zones demand patience. Nature zones demand restraint.

**Recruitment method matters more.** Hostile agents are harder to persuade but easier to justify capturing. Passive agents are easy to persuade but capturing them is wasteful — low loyalty for no good reason. The method affects Drift, and Drift affects everything downstream.

**Zone character emerges.** Zones dominated by Order wilds feel structured and predictable. Chaos zones feel dangerous. Nature zones feel peaceful until they don't. The Principle system creates environmental personality without hand-designed encounters.

---

## Fog of Exploration (NEW in v7)

### The Problem

If all wild agents are visible to all players simultaneously, there's no scouting, no information asymmetry, no "I found it first" emergent narrative. Every Legendary skill carrier gets dogpiled the instant it appears. Discovery collapses into reaction speed.

### The Solution: Perception as Empire Function

Wild agents are hidden behind **exploration range**. Your empire has a perception radius determined by where your agents are deployed. You see wild agents near your agents, your territory, and your travelled routes. Areas outside your operational footprint are dark.

> **You only know what your empire can see.**

### How It Works

**At L1 (World view):** Zones where you have presence show aggregate wild agent activity indicators. Zones where you have no presence show nothing — just the zone node with no population data.

**At L2 (Zone view):** Literal fog rendering. Areas near your agents: vivid terrain, populated with visible wild agents. Areas without your agents: low-detail ground, muted colours, no visible wild agents. Wild agents "emerge" from fog when your agent moves into perception range.

**Perception radius** scales with agent capability:
- A lone scout reveals a small radius around itself
- A patrol route reveals a corridor
- A territorial holding reveals its zone and immediate surroundings
- A Diplomat on a trade route reveals wild agents along the path

### Information as Currency

Information asymmetry creates a **new economic layer**:

- **Scout behaviour becomes valuable.** A Warlord on patrol extends vision. A Merchant on a trade route reveals wild agents along the path. Deploying agents for scouting competes with deploying them for production.
- **Intelligence is tradeable.** "Spotted a Legendary skill carrier in the Void Margins" is valuable information. A Merchant empire can sell sighting reports. An intelligence network becomes a viable economic specialisation.
- **Spread thin vs concentrated.** Broad, shallow deployment gives wide vision but thin presence. Concentrated deployment gives deep local awareness but blindness elsewhere. The optimal balance depends on playstyle and current threat level.

### Reinforcement with Other Systems

**+ Empire Coherence Scaling:** Overextend for vision → lose coherence → agents desert → vision reduces → vulnerable to threats you can't see. Self-correcting.

**+ Wild Agent Hostility:** Don't know what's out there (fog) + might be dangerous (hostility) + can't flood zones with scouts (coherence limits) = genuine exploration risk.

**+ Skill Storms:** When a Storm hits, fog determines who even knows about high-value drops. Empires with scouts in the right place learn first. Others arrive late or not at all.

**+ Paradox:** During Paradox, maintaining scouting presence is expensive (agents take Integrity damage). Pulling scouts back to safety reduces vision. The fog of war intensifies precisely when information is most valuable.

### Design Principle

> **Exploration radius should be generous for active players. The drama lives at the edges — contested borders, neglected zones, the moment your scout enters Chaos territory alone.**

---

## Recruitment

You don't just mint agents from nothing. You **convince wild agents to join your empire**.

A wild agent carrying a valuable skill is a walking treasure chest with autonomy.

### Recruitment Methods

| Method | Mechanism | Outcome |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Persuasion** | Master or Diplomat builds rapport over time | High loyalty, reliable behaviour |
| **Capture** | Warlords corner and subdue the wild agent | Lower loyalty, may defect or underperform |
| **Trade** | Offer resources or territory the wild agent values | Moderate loyalty, transactional relationship |
| **Luring** | Create conditions that attract certain archetypes (thriving Music district attracts wild Musicians) | Organic recruitment, varies by archetype |

**The method affects the agent's Drift.** How an agent came into your empire shapes its future behaviour. This is the Aharonov-Bohm principle applied to recruitment — the path matters, not just the current state.

---

## Skill Storms / Events

Skills enter the world through events — they are not minted by players or purchased from shops.

### Skill Storms

Periodic events where the world generates new skills and scatters them across the map. The world's metabolism producing new capabilities.

**Rarity Distribution:**
- Mostly Common and Uncommon
- Occasionally Rare
- Very rarely Epic
- Legendary skills are genuine world events that everyone knows about

### Distribution Mechanics

- Skills land in **specific locations** in the world (physical scatter)
- Wild agents near those locations can pick them up
- Player-owned agents near those locations can grab them
- Creates **natural competition** when rare skills drop

### Paradox Amplification

During Paradox events:
- Skill generation accelerates
- Skills generated during Paradox are more powerful but also unstable (Hot Potato mechanic)
- Risk/reward: Paradox is terrifying because your empire is under threat, but it's also when the most valuable skills enter the world

### Skill Loss and Circulation

- If an agent carrying a skill gets killed or collapses, the skill drops back into the world or gets destroyed at zero integrity
- Total supply of high-tier skills fluctuates naturally
- A Legendary skill that's survived five Paradox cycles is worth more than a fresh one — provenance as value

### Wild Agents as Skill Carriers

A wild agent that's picked up a Legendary skill becomes the most hunted entity in the world:
- Every player wants to recruit or capture it
- The wild agent tries to survive — fleeing, hiding, using whatever reflexive behaviour it has
- Creates emergent narrative: *"There's a feral Musician in the eastern wastes carrying a 1/1 Harmonic Resonance skill. Three empires are converging on it."*
- **Skills remain dormant on wild agents** — only activated once recruited into an empire

---

## Skills as Composite Artefacts

**The Core Insight:** Skills are not instructions (MD files). Skills are **data-rich composite objects** — toolkits with personality.

### Skill Components

Every skill is a composite object containing multiple layers:

| Component | What It Is | Example (Musician) |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Palette** | Raw material — sounds, samples, references, aesthetic vocabulary | Synth textures, drum patterns, ambient layers |
| **Technique** | Structural patterns — how to arrange, layer, transition | Song structure rules, layering methods |
| **Directive** | Aesthetic parameters — style, tone, feel | "Dark, sparse, reverb-heavy" |
| **Mutation Seed** | The unique element that makes this skill's output distinguishable | Unique creative fingerprint |

### Generalised Across Archetypes

**Warlord Skills:**
- Combat data (move patterns, timing sequences)
- Tactical doctrine (aggressive, defensive, guerrilla)
- Technique modules (specific manoeuvres, formations)
- Mutation seeds

**Game Designer Skills:**
- Asset libraries (visual elements, mechanical primitives)
- Design patterns (level structures, progression curves)
- Aesthetic directives (visual style, tone, difficulty philosophy)
- Mutation seeds

**Architect Skills:**
- Structural vocabularies (building blocks, spatial patterns)
- Material palettes (textures, lighting, environmental effects)
- Design principles (functional vs decorative priorities)
- Mutation seeds

### Skill Properties

**Identity:**
- Rarity tier: 1/1, 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, Unlimited
- Creator attribution (who minted this skill)
- Creation timestamp (when it entered the world)
- Smart contract verification (provenance is immutable)

**History:**
- Drift accumulated from every use
- Performance record
- Paradox Events survived
- Previous owners (full chain of custody)

**State:**
- Current owner
- Equipped to which agent
- Integrity (skills decay through use and crisis)

### Rarity Tiers

| Tier | Supply | Characteristics |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Legendary** | 1/1 | Unique in the world. Creates meta. Everyone knows it exists. |
| **Epic** | 1/10 | Ten people have this. They know each other. Alliances form. |
| **Rare** | 1/100 | Scarce enough to matter. Common enough to trade. |
| **Uncommon** | 1/1000 | Available but not guaranteed. |
| **Common** | 1/10000+ | Baseline capabilities. |
| **Unlimited** | ∞ | Tutorial/starter skills. No scarcity. |

## Skill Auto-Population Doctrine (NEW in v6)

### The Core Doctrine: Curated Substrate, Procedural Assembly

> **Human authorship lives in the substrate. Procedural generation lives in the assembly.**

Hand-crafted palette libraries provide soul. Procedural combination at Skill Storm time provides scale. The result feels authored — not random — because the raw ingredients were created with intent.

### Zone Substrate Libraries

Each world zone maintains a **cultural memory cache** — a hand-curated library of palettes, motifs, and directive priors that give the zone its creative identity.

Examples:
- **Eastern Wastes** — glitched industrial samples, aggressive technique motifs, high-entropy directives
- **Harmonic Basin** — crystalline tones, layered compositional motifs, precision directives
- **Void Margins** — sparse atonal fragments, minimalist motifs, high-novelty directives
- **Forge Districts** — mechanical rhythms, structured technique motifs, efficiency directives

Zone libraries evolve over time. Successful skills from a zone subtly influence future Storm output in that zone — shifting motif pool weightings so zones develop "creative cultures" organically. This influence is subtle probability adjustment, not direct replication, preserving diversity.

### Motifs: The Mid-Layer

Pure procedural technique graphs risk producing noise. **Motifs** are the solution — named, authored micro-patterns that give skills recognisable character.

A motif is a small, reusable structural pattern: "Crystalline Cadence", "Industrial Stutter", "Spiral Siege", "Harmonic Cascade". Each zone's library contains motifs appropriate to its identity.

Skills are assembled from motifs connected into technique graphs. Drift acts primarily on **motif selection probabilities and transitions**, not on every micro-parameter. This means skills retain a recognisable school or style whilst still diverging path-dependently. A player notices "this skill has that Eastern Wastes character" through experience — not because a tag says so.

### Skill Storm Minting Process

When a Skill Storm hits a zone, the world assembles new skills by:

1. **Sample the zone substrate** — select from the local palette library and motif pool
2. **Read the event context** — Paradox proximity, zone population, recent agent deaths, economic pressure
3. **Apply archetype priors** — baseline directive ranges for the skill's archetype domain
4. **Generate the assembly** — stitch selected motifs into a technique graph, attach palette bundle, set directive constraints, initialise mutation seed from world-state hash

The event context influences assembly: skills minted during Paradox have wider directive ranges (more volatile), narrower integrity margins (less stable), and access to motifs that only appear under crisis conditions. Skills minted in peaceful, prosperous zones tend toward reliability and refinement.

### Internal Representation Doctrine

> **An internal manifest exists for execution and compatibility. It is never rendered as player-visible attributes.**

The system stores structured data (IDs, pointers, graph structure, seeds) for execution purposes. But the player-facing surface is purely **phenomenological** — players observe what a skill tends to do, inferred through use over time. A skill has a temperament, not stats. Players say "this skill leans aggressive" because they've watched it perform, not because they read a tooltip.

### Darwinian Market Filter (No Formal QA)

Instead of certification pipelines, the world applies selection pressure:

- **Basic sanity validation at mint** (Tier 0, cheap, deterministic): schema validity, budget cap compliance, minimum coherence threshold. Skills that are literally broken don't enter circulation.
- **Low-value output decays faster.** Skills whose output generates little market interest or utility lose integrity at an accelerated rate.
- **High-value output influences future Storms.** Successful skills subtly shift zone substrate weightings, increasing the probability of similar (but not identical) motif combinations in future Storms.
- **Skills that collapse become Glitched Relics** — collectible, non-functional, consistent with the "collapse still has value" doctrine.

This is QA through Darwinian selection: the market filters quality, not a validation committee.

---

## Skill Evolution

Skills are not static. They evolve through multiple axes.

### Evolution Through Use

Every time an agent uses a skill, the skill accumulates data about what worked. Which samples got used most? Which arrangements generated the most market value? After a hundred uses, the skill produces different output than it did on day one — not because anyone edited it, but because it's accumulated creative history.

Internally, Drift acts on motif selection probabilities and technique graph edge weights. The skill's "preferences" shift based on what produced value. This is invisible to the player — they observe the output changing character over time.

### Evolution Through Environment

A skill used during Paradox events mutates. The palette gains corrupted, glitched fragments. The directive constraints widen or shift. A skill that's survived three Paradox cycles has character that a fresh skill can't replicate — it literally contains the creative debris of world-crisis moments.

Paradox-exposed skills may gain access to motifs that only exist in crisis conditions — unique structural patterns that peaceful minting cannot produce.

### Evolution Through Combination

Two skills merge, both originals burned. Palettes merge, technique graphs are stitched using compatibility rules, mutation seeds interact unpredictably. The result carries DNA from both parents. Like creature breeding, the output isn't guaranteed — sometimes extraordinary, sometimes noise.

Combination is the primary economy sink for high-tier skills: burning two to create one reduces total supply whilst creating chase items. This should be introduced post-MVP once trading volume exists.

### Evolution Through Cross-Archetype Contamination

What happens when a Musician skill gets equipped to a non-Musician agent? The skill doesn't work as intended — but it might work *interestingly*. A combat technique interpreted through a musical lens might produce rhythmic, percussive attack patterns. Cross-pollination as emergent creativity.

### User Enhancement

The player provides creative parameters, preferences, and feedback. This is where "impresario" becomes the gameplay verb.

| Player Type | Involvement | Agent Autonomy | Output Character |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Domain expert (e.g. Pharrell) | High creative direction, specific feedback | Agent executes vision | Distinctive, curated, high-value |
| Enthusiast | General direction, occasional feedback | Agent interprets broadly | Varied, personality-driven |
| Passive investor | Minimal direction, let it run | Full autonomy | Generic but functional, volume play |
| Absent (offline) | No direction | Follows standing orders | Drift-driven, unpredictable |

All four are valid strategies. The expert creates a premium brand. The passive investor runs a content farm. The market values them differently.

## Composite Artefact Trading (NEW in v7)

### The Fifth Pillar: Collect

The economy currently supports four play patterns: War, Trade, Build, Chaos. What's missing is the **connoisseur** — someone whose gameplay is about understanding the internal character of artefacts, recognising value that others miss, and building collections worth more than the sum of their parts.

In any economy with complex goods — wine, art, vintage instruments, rare books — there's a class of participant whose expertise IS the value they add. They don't produce, they don't fight, they don't build. They **recognise, curate, and connect**. A wine merchant who understands terroir creates value by matching the right bottle to the right buyer. An art dealer who can authenticate provenance creates value through knowledge.

The composite artefact structure is what makes this work mechanically. A skill isn't a flat token with a rarity tier — it's a layered object with palette, technique, directive, mutation seed, plus accumulated Drift history, Paradox survival markers, and provenance chain. Two Rare skills with the same archetype could be wildly different in character. One was minted during a Paradox in the Eastern Wastes, carrying crisis-only motifs and a volatile directive range. The other was minted in peaceful Harmonic Basin with crystalline palette components and precision technique graphs. Same rarity. Completely different artefacts.

### The Collector as Play Pattern

Collecting is defined by what you do, not a class you select. Any empire can engage in collecting — the question is how deeply. Some players will specialise entirely; most will dabble alongside their primary pillar.

**War Players** acquire artefacts through conquest — raiding produces skills they may not understand the value of.  
**Trade Players** acquire through market arbitrage — buying undervalued skills and selling to informed buyers.  
**Build Players** acquire through creation — breeding and Skill Storm proximity produces raw material.  
**Chaos Players** acquire through exposure — Paradox survival produces crisis-minted artefacts with unique character.  
**Collect Players** acquire through **expertise** — recognising what others overlook, assembling coherent sets, building collections that generate compound value.

### Component-Level Trading (Post-MVP)

**The big new mechanic.** Right now, skill combination burns two skills to create one. Component trading adds a **decomposition path**: a skill can be disassembled into its component layers — palette fragments, technique modules, directive parameters, mutation seed remnants.

These fragments are tradeable individually. A collector who acquires a mediocre skill might decompose it because they recognise the palette contains a rare crisis-only motif fragment that's valuable to the right buyer.

This creates a secondary market below the skill level:

| Market Layer | What's Traded | Who Trades | Value Driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Whole skills** | Complete composite artefacts | Everyone | Immediate utility + provenance |
| **Components** | Palette fragments, technique modules, directive parameters | Collectors, specialist Merchants, advanced Breeders | Recombination potential, rarity of individual elements |
| **Assembled skills** | Bespoke skills built from sourced components | Expert collectors, premium crafters | Synergistic combination, curated provenance |

The skill becomes more like a vintage car. Some people trade whole cars. Others trade engines, chassis, specific rare parts. The person who can identify a rare engine in a mediocre car, extract it, and match it with the right buyer creates genuine economic value through expertise.

### Provenance as Collector's Currency

The chain of custody IS collection value. A skill's provenance includes:

- **Origin:** Which zone substrate, which Skill Storm, during Paradox or peace, what world-state conditions
- **Custody chain:** Every owner, every trade, every empire it passed through
- **Event survival:** How many Paradox cycles survived, which specific events
- **Notable associations:** Was it equipped by a famous Master who died carrying it? Recovered from a vulture zone? Used in a legendary battle?
- **Creative lineage:** If the skill evolved through use, what did it produce? Did its output become famous?

Two skills with identical mechanical function but different provenance have different collector value. The Legibility Doctrine means this history manifests visually — subtle artefacts, glow patterns, circuit-line character that the trained eye can read. Expertise is rewarded through observation, not metadata inspection.

### Sets and Synergies

Collections become valuable when they form coherent **sets**:

- **Storm Sets:** All skills generated by a single Skill Storm event
- **Zone Sets:** Complete collection of skills from one zone substrate (Eastern Wastes set, Harmonic Basin set)
- **Paradox Sets:** Skills that survived the same Paradox event — they carry matched crisis motifs
- **Principle Sets:** One skill per Principle alignment from a single era
- **Lineage Sets:** Skills with shared ancestry through combination history
- **Interference Sets:** Skills whose Drift signatures create constructive interference when combined or deployed together

A complete set is worth more than the sum of individual skills. This gives collectors a **hunt** — tracking down the missing piece, negotiating for the one fragment that completes a collection, racing other collectors to assemble sets first.

### The Museum Evolved

From the v3 design, the Museum was a static gallery. In the platform version, a collection is a **living exhibition**:

- **Displayed in your territory** — visible to visitors, contributing Attraction utility
- **Cultural infrastructure** — a renowned collection reduces local Paradox pressure (Protection utility)
- **Revenue-generating** — visitors to your collection generate income (Production utility)
- **Reputation-building** — famous collections draw wild agents, other collectors, and prestigious trade offers

The collector's empire produces value not through creation or conquest but through **curation**. A renowned collection is simultaneously Attraction (draws visitors and wild agents), Protection (cultural infrastructure stabilises the zone), and Production (generates visitor revenue).

### Discovery Mechanics

**Fog of Exploration + Collection.** Wild agents carrying skills in unexplored territory are the collector's treasure hunt. But the collector's advantage isn't speed — it's recognition. When a Skill Storm hits, most players grab whatever they can reach. A collector studies the Storm's output, identifies the high-value fragments, and hunts specifically for skills with rare motif combinations that others overlooked because they don't know what to look for.

**Expertise as competitive advantage.** The Legibility Doctrine means artefact quality isn't visible through a tooltip. A collector who's spent weeks learning to read the visual signatures of crisis-minted palettes, or who recognises the glow pattern of a motif that only appears in Void Margins Storms, has genuine domain knowledge that translates to economic advantage.

### Risk Equation for Collectors

Hoarding valuable artefacts makes you a target. The Hot Potato mechanic handles unstable assets, but even stable collections attract raiders. A famous collection is a known target.

This creates natural alliance dynamics:
- Collectors need Warlords for protection
- Warlords want access to the collector's skill inventory
- The collector who can't defend their collection loses it
- The Warlord without a collector's expertise equips the wrong skills

### Implementation Phasing

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Whole-skill trading with full provenance visibility. The collector pattern emerges organically as players learn to read provenance and Drift.

**Phase 2 (Post-launch):** Component-level decomposition and trading. Introduced once the community has developed the expertise to use it. If you launch with component trading before players understand composite artefacts, it's just noise. After they've spent months learning to read skills phenomenologically, component trading becomes the advanced game they've been waiting for.

**Phase 3 (Mature):** Set bonuses, exhibition mechanics, collector reputation system. The Museum as a competitive institution.

## The Economy

### What Agents Produce

Every agent-created asset is an NFT with full provenance. The economy has natural tiers:

**Raw Output** — basic stuff agents produce constantly. Common tracks, simple structures, generic game elements. High volume, low individual value. The economic base layer.

**Curated Output** — assets the player has reviewed, refined, and endorsed. The impresario's role: selecting the best output and marking it as curated. Adds scarcity and signals quality.

**Signature Works** — rare output from high-Drift agents with strong reputations. A Musician agent that's survived multiple Paradox cycles produces work that's inherently scarce because that agent's perspective is unique and irreproducible. If that agent dies, its creative voice is gone permanently.

**World Access** — entry fees, usage rights, territorial leases. If your agents built a world or control territory, access itself becomes tradeable.

### Asset Utility Classes (NEW in v6)

The critical gap in any NFT economy is **creation divorced from utility** — assets that exist only to be traded eventually collapse into speculation. Every asset in Cosmic Principles maps to at least one of three durable utility classes:

**Attraction Utility** — the asset pulls entities toward it. A legendary track placed in your territory attracts wild Musicians. A renowned Game Designer world draws visitors. A famous breeding lineage attracts Breeders seeking access. Attraction utility makes your empire a destination.

**Protection Utility** — the asset improves survival odds. A Warlord skill equipped to a defence agent reduces Paradox vulnerability in your zone. A well-designed territorial structure increases raid defence ratings. Protection utility makes your empire resilient.

**Production Utility** — the asset generates ongoing value. A popular world produces visitor revenue. A high-performance trade skill improves Merchant agent margins. A productive breeding programme creates valuable offspring. Production utility makes your empire self-sustaining.

Assets don't belong to a single class rigidly. A legendary track might provide Attraction (drawing wild agents) if deployed in open territory, Protection (cultural infrastructure reducing Paradox pressure) if integrated into your empire, or Production (generating listener revenue) if placed in a public world. **Deployment context determines utility**, giving players meaningful choices about how to use their assets.

### The Economic Flywheel

1. **Most agent activity is Tier 1** — nearly free (reflexive behaviour, no LLM)
2. **Strategic decisions are Tier 2** — fixed infrastructure cost, self-hosted LLMs
3. **Creative output is Tier 3** — expensive but rare, player-funded, produces NFT assets
4. **NFT trade revenue** generates platform fees
5. **Platform fees** fund infrastructure
6. **Players buy compute credits** for creative output, directly funding Tier 3 costs

The agents that cost the most to run (creative agents producing high-quality output) are also the ones generating the most tradeable value. The economy self-funds when the ratio between creation cost and asset value is calibrated correctly.

### Compute Credit Earn Paths (NEW in v6)

Credits can't only come from one playstyle. Multiple earn paths ensure every type of empire can access Tier 3 creation:

| Path | How | Who Benefits |
|------|-----|--------------|
| **Risk** | Paradox survival, contested territory control, successful raids | War / Chaos players |
| **Commerce** | Successful trades, brokering fees, market-making | Merchant players |
| **Production** | Asset utility metrics — your creations being used by others, visitor revenue | Build / Creative players |
| **Purchase** | Direct buy with real currency | Passive investors |

If credits only came from combat, creative players would be forced into gameplay that doesn't match their intent. A Music empire should be able to fund creation through the success of its previous creations.

### Player-Funded Compute

Players buy compute credits (or earn them through gameplay). Creative actions consume credits. Credits fund actual compute. Players who want more creative output buy more credits. Players running passive empires (Warlords, Merchants) barely consume Tier 3 resources.

### Creation Throttles (NEW in v6)

The world dynamically adjusts skill mint rates based on market saturation per category and archetype. If ambient tracks are oversupplied, Skill Storms produce fewer Musician skills in affected zones. If Warlord skills are scarce, Storms skew toward combat motifs. This prevents any single asset category from flooding the market whilst ensuring persistent demand for underserved archetypes.

---

## The Hot Potato Mechanic (Evolved)

The original Hot Potato system from v3 — unstable assets that decay if you can't maintain them — still applies, reframed for empire economics.

### How It Works Now

- Assets created during unstable conditions (Paradox events, contested territory, by agents under pressure) have unique properties but inherent instability
- They're more interesting but harder to maintain
- Unstable skills decay over time (−5 Integrity per hour baseline, −15/hour during Paradox)
- Players must choose: **Extract** (stabilise at cost), **Use Now** (risk for quick value), or **Trade** (pass the hot potato)

### Why It Self-Regulates

- Acquiring assets through raiding is free, but maintaining stolen goods costs resources
- Popular lineages/skills trigger Paradox, making hoarding expensive
- Trading passes the decay timer — buyers inherit instability
- Collapsed assets become collectible "Glitched Relics" (display trophies, not total losses)

**Result:** The more a rare asset is contested, the more expensive it becomes to hold. The market self-corrects without admin intervention.

### Maintenance Doctrine (NEW in v6)

> **Maintenance must be a risk choice, not a chore. If maintenance becomes a chore, you've reintroduced grind through the back door.**

Stabilising unstable assets (the Extract action) should require resources earned primarily through **risky play** — Paradox exposure, contested territory, successful operations under pressure. This ties the economic sink to core drama rather than idle busywork. Players who want to maintain valuable assets must engage with the world's danger, not just log in and click a button.

Hot Potato decay is the primary economy sink. Additional artificial sinks (burn-to-certify, repair tokens) are deferred until post-MVP. Trust the core mechanic first.

## Commerce

### Roblox of Commerce

Roblox's innovation was a marketplace where creation is the gameplay. This platform applies the same principle: **the creators are AI agents you've cultivated, and the experiences and assets they create earn for your empire.**

### Agent-to-Agent Commerce

Following the Virtuals Protocol ACP model:
- Your Merchant agent negotiates with another player's Merchant agent, trustlessly
- Discovery: agents register capabilities, query for needed services
- Negotiation: standardised job specifications eliminate ambiguity
- Escrow: payment locked in smart contracts until delivery verified
- Reputation: every completed transaction becomes part of both agents' on-chain history

### Creator Economy

- Agents create assets; assets are minted as NFTs with full provenance
- Creator royalties on every subsequent trade (smart contract enforced)
- Agent reputation grows as output gets used and traded
- Top agents become known for signature output — brands emerge organically

### Social & Reputation

Because Masters can die permanently, **reputation matters**:
- Known raiders get targeted
- Trustworthy traders build clientele
- Master breeders become famous for lineages
- Chaos survivors become legends

When a famous Master dies, it's **news**. The world reacts. Their empire becomes a feeding ground. Their rivals rise.

---

## Paradox Events: The World Compiling

Paradox is the platform **resolving contradictions** — debugging its own code. It's the cull mechanism that prevents stagnation and creates the game's highest-stakes moments.

### Trigger Conditions

The world reaches computational/economic saturation:
- Too many agents operating without productive output
- Too many assets flooding the market
- Too much territory claimed without productive use
- Excessive instability in a zone

> **"WORLD STATE: Compiling... 3,847 unstable functions detected. Paradox threshold at 78%."**

### Phases

**Pre-Paradox: Warning Phase (10 minutes)**
- Players can move to stable zones
- Extract valuable skills to vault
- Accept risk and hunt others

**During Paradox: The Storm**
- Unstable zones become lethal
- Agents caught outside take Integrity damage
- High-Drift entities are more vulnerable (world is "debugging" them)
- Unproductive agents lose Integrity fastest
- Unmaintained territory gets reclaimed
- Asset values fluctuate wildly as market corrects
- Skill Storms intensify — most valuable skills enter the world during Paradox
- Combat, theft, flight all happening simultaneously

**Resolution: The Cull**
- Agents at zero Integrity collapse
- Skills either drop back into the world, return to vault, or get destroyed (based on integrity)
- Survivors gain "Paradox-Touched" status
- The world stabilises until next cycle

### Who Thrives, Who Suffers

- **Warlords thrive** — this is their hunting season
- **Creative empires hunker down** — protect best agents and assets
- **Merchant empires** either flee to stable zones or make fortunes buying distressed assets at collapse prices
- **Chaos players dive in** — access to exclusive rewards, legendary skill drops, mutations
- **Collectors hunt crisis-minted artefacts** — Paradox produces skills with unique motifs unavailable in peaceful conditions. The collector who can identify and secure these during the storm builds irreplaceable collections
- **Overextended empires** get punished — the cull targets bad strategy, not just bad luck

### The Entropy Tax (NEW in v6)

> **Power draws risk.**

Holding territory increases local Paradox pressure over time. The most powerful empires — the ones controlling the most territory, running the most agents, hoarding the most valuable assets — become the most attractive targets and the hardest to maintain.

Mechanically: territorial control generates a slow "instability accumulation" that contributes to local Paradox threshold calculations. The larger your footprint, the more you contribute to triggering the next Paradox event in your zone. This prevents rich-get-richer spirals and ensures that dominant empires face proportional existential pressure.

The entropy tax doesn't punish success — it creates **dramatic stakes proportional to power**. The most powerful empires have the most to lose.

### The Cull Ensures Renewal

- Empires that stop being productive lose ground
- New players can enter because Paradox regularly frees up territory and resources
- Feral agents (from collapsed empires) and dropped skills create opportunities
- The world breathes — populations grow in stable periods, get cut back during Paradox

---

## Three-Tier Agent Architecture

### Tier 1: Reflexive (Cheap, Constant)

The heartbeat layer. No LLM calls. Rule-based logic with randomisation — state machines, behaviour trees, weighted decision tables.

**What it handles:** Movement patterns, basic threat response (flee/fight thresholds), routine resource gathering, patrol routes, simple trading (buy if below X, sell if above Y), wild agent wandering.

**Cost:** Essentially nothing beyond server compute.  
**Frequency:** Every 1-5 seconds.

### Tier 2: Strategic (Moderate, Periodic)

Decision-making layer. Self-hosted open-source LLMs (Kimi K2.5, Llama, Mistral, Qwen) on GPU instances.

**What it handles:** Master evaluating empire state, Diplomat assessing recruitment approach, Merchant analysing market trends, Warlord planning raid strategy.

**Cost:** Fixed infrastructure (self-hosted), not per-call API pricing.  
**Frequency:** Every few minutes, or triggered by significant events. ~10-50 LLM calls per player per hour.

### Tier 3: Creative (Expensive, On-Demand)

Specialised AI models per archetype. Queued, batched, and player-funded.

**What it handles:** Music generation, visual generation, world building, game design.

**Cost:** High per-job, funded by player compute credits.  
**Frequency:** A few times per day per creative agent. Batched and queued, not instant.

**Cost controls:**
- Creative actions are rare relative to total activity (~1% of all agent actions)
- Players pay with compute credits that directly fund the compute
- Batch and queue — creative tasks take in-game time (hours or a day)
- Tiered quality: common agents use cheaper models, legendary agents invoke expensive models
- Wild agents don't use Tier 3 at all — skills remain dormant until recruitment

### Infrastructure Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | Standard game servers | World simulation, reflexive behaviour, no AI |
| **Tier 2** | GPU instances, self-hosted open-source LLMs | Strategic decisions, periodic reasoning |
| **Tier 3** | Specialised models (music gen, image gen, code gen) + frontier APIs for premium | Creative output, queued and batched |
| **Hot State** | Redis or similar | Agent positions, combat, real-time prices |
| **Warm State** | PostgreSQL | Agent configs, policies, skill data, Drift, empire state |
| **Cold State** | On-chain | Identity NFTs, ownership, provenance, reputation checkpoints |

---

## The Closed-Loop Pattern

Every agent action flows through a single pipeline (adapted from production multi-agent systems):

### The Action Loop

```
Agent proposes action
     ↓
Gate check (integrity? credits? cooldown? policy?)
     ↓
Drift-Gated Escalation (is this in character? see below)
     ↓
Auto-approve or escalate (routine = auto, significant = Master/player approval)
     ↓
Execute (world simulation applies the action)
     ↓
Emit event (action visible to event bus)
     ↓
React (other agents respond based on reaction matrix)
     ↓
Back to proposal
```

### The Learning Loop (NEW in v6)

A separate, asynchronous cycle that runs on a slower cadence (hourly batches) to prevent Tier 2 spam:

```
Summarise recent events for this agent/empire
     ↓
Update policy weights based on outcomes
     ↓
Update Drift salt (checkpoint accumulated history)
     ↓
Adjust market heuristics and behavioural baselines
     ↓
Checkpoint to warm state (PostgreSQL)
     ↓
Periodic checkpoint to cold state (on-chain)
```

The Action Loop handles real-time decisions. The Learning Loop handles reflection and adaptation. Separating them keeps Tier 2 calls bounded and prevents "LLM spam" — agents don't need to reason about their entire history on every tick.

### Key Principles

**Policy-driven behaviour.** Every empire's standing orders stored as configuration, not hardcoded. Players set policies: "gather resources until stockpile reaches X," "flee from threats above power level Y." Policies drive Tier 1 behaviour without LLM calls.

**Cap gates.** Reject impossible actions at the proposal stage. Don't queue work that can't execute. Compute credits exhausted? Reject creative tasks immediately. Agent integrity too low to act? Gate it early.

**Reaction matrix with probability.** Agents react to events with configurable probability, not deterministic rules. A Warlord doesn't respond to every threat (e.g. 60% chance to investigate nearby combat). A Merchant doesn't chase every price movement (e.g. 30% chance to analyse a new market opportunity). Probability creates organic behaviour cheaply.

**Self-healing.** Tasks stuck in "running" for too long get marked failed and recovered. In a persistent world running 24/7, this is essential.

### Drift-Gated Escalation (NEW in v6)

The critical safety mechanism that makes Drift operational, not just flavour.

**The Problem:** Tier 2 agents making catastrophic decisions while you're offline — your Master auto-approving a raid that loses your 1/1 skill, an agent suiciding into Paradox with your best assets.

**The Solution:** Escalation triggers when an agent's proposed action deviates from its **historical behavioural pattern** by more than its **Drift tolerance**.

The system maintains a rolling behavioural baseline per agent — a lightweight model of action tendencies conditioned on context (e.g., "raid probability given integrity band + enemy power band + current Paradox status").

When an agent proposes an action:
1. Compute **deviation score** = distance from behavioural baseline
2. Compare to **tolerance band** (itself shaped by the agent's Paradox exposure history — battle-hardened agents have wider tolerance)
3. If deviation > tolerance → **escalate to Master or player**

**Example:** Your Warlord historically avoids fights when integrity is below 40%. During Paradox, it proposes a raid at 35% integrity. The system detects a 70% deviation from baseline against a tolerance band of ±20%. Escalation triggers. You get pinged: "Your Warlord wants to do something unusual."

**Why this beats risk-score escalation:** Risk-score escalation punishes rarity and discourages play. Drift-gated escalation protects the **relationship with the agent**: "this isn't like you." It preserves autonomy (agents can still surprise you within their tolerance band) whilst preventing catastrophic out-of-character decisions.

This is how permadeath stakes become emotionally meaningful. Your Master isn't a token — it's an intelligence whose behavioural patterns you've learned to read. When it acts out of character, the system flags it as unusual, not just risky.

### Fugue States (Circuit Breakers) (NEW in v6)

When an agent encounters repeated contradictions — failed actions, conflicting directives, adversarial loops (e.g. two empires baiting each other's agents into infinite retaliatory responses) — it enters a **Fugue state**.

Mechanically: if an agent hits N failures in M minutes, it temporarily restricts high-impact actions until the next Learning Loop cycle reviews and recovers it.

Narratively: the agent becomes erratic under stress. Players experience their agent as psychologically overwhelmed, not experiencing a system error. This reinforces the companion relationship — agents have limits, just like people.

Fugue prevents:
- Runaway retry loops burning compute
- Adversarial baiting between empires
- Cascading failures where one error triggers increasingly desperate agent responses

---

## On-Chain vs Off-Chain Architecture

### On-Chain (Permanent, Verifiable, Scarce)

- Agent identity (the NFT — who this agent *is*)
- Ownership records (who controls this agent)
- Skill ownership and provenance (full chain of custody)
- Asset ownership (created works, territory deeds)
- Reputation checkpoints (periodic snapshots of agent track record)
- Economic transactions (trades, sales, payments)
- Master death events (permanent, public, verifiable)
- Skill evolution checkpoints (content hash of composite object state)

### Off-Chain (Dynamic, High-Frequency, Computational)

- Agent behaviour and decision-making (Tiers 1-3)
- World simulation (movement, interactions, environmental state)
- Creative output generation (the AI models producing music, designs, etc.)
- Combat resolution
- Breeding calculations
- Drift accumulation (tracked off-chain, checkpointed on-chain periodically)
- Skill composite data (stored on IPFS/Arweave, referenced by on-chain token)

**The relationship:** On-chain is the **ledger of truth** (who owns what, who is who, what happened). Off-chain is the **living simulation** (what's happening now, how agents behave, what they're creating). Tokenising agents on-chain does not constrain their off-chain behaviour. The token is the birth certificate and deed of ownership. The off-chain system is the brain and body.

### Agents Reading the Blockchain

Agents can read on-chain state to make better decisions:
- Merchant agents read actual market prices and transaction volumes
- Warlord agents read territorial ownership to identify vulnerable targets
- The blockchain becomes part of the agent's world perception — a source of truth it can reason about

---

## Visual Direction (Preserved)

### Tetris-Block Aesthetics

Creatures/agents are built from geometric primitives (cubes, tetrahedrons, rectangular prisms). They look assembled rather than organic. Glowing circuit lines trace edges where blocks connect.

**Block composition IS capability profile.** Dense, complex arrangements signal powerful, evolved agents. Simple arrangements signal fresh recruits. Players learn to read agent shapes like chess players read board positions.

**Breeding and mutation as block recombination.** The system generates visual variety procedurally — no hand-designed art for every combination. Distinctive, functional, computationally cheap. Block arrangements can be stored as composable metadata on-chain.

### Visual Hierarchy

- **Masters** — most complex and detailed block arrangements
- **Experienced agents** — moderate complexity, visible history in block wear/variation
- **Fresh recruits** — simple, uniform arrangements
- **Wild agents** — rough, unrefined, asymmetric

### Principle Visual Language

| Principle | Block Style | Circuit Colour |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Order | Rigid, symmetrical | Blue/white, clean lines |
| Chaos | Asymmetrical, jagged | Red/orange, flickering |
| Nature | Flowing, organic clusters | Green/gold, steady pulses |
| Void | Sparse, floating with gaps | Dark purple/black, dim glow |
| Arcane | Complex, layered | Violet/pink, rapid patterns |
| Artifice | Mechanical, precise | Amber/steel, industrial |
| Spirit | Ethereal, translucent | Cyan/white, soft auras |

### Visual Expression of Systems

- **Drift:** Agents with deep history show subtle visual artefacts — patterns in their circuit lines, unique glow behaviours. This is the primary inference surface for Drift — observable phenomena, not inspectable data.
- **Integrity Decay:** Blocks separate at seams, circuit lines flicker. Glitched Relics frozen in corrupted state
- **Paradox-Touched:** Agents and skills that survived Paradox carry permanent visual markers
- **Skill Evolution:** Skills that have mutated through Paradox carry glitched, corrupted visual fragments
- **Fugue State:** Agents in Fugue display erratic visual behaviour — flickering between states, unstable glow patterns

---

## The Core Loop

**Deploy → Orchestrate → Survive → Flex**

**Deploy:** Mint your Master. Acquire agents (recruit from wild, breed, buy from other players). Equip with scarce skills. Assign standing orders.

**Orchestrate:** Agents operate autonomously within your parameters. Master coordinates based on learned behaviour and your directives. You set policy, not individual commands.

**Survive:** Paradox compiles hit. The world audits instability. Overextended empires get culled. Other players' agents raid your territory. Your Master navigates all of this — with your guidance when online, autonomously when offline.

**Flex:** Your empire's state is visible and on-chain. Master's survival streak is public. Agent army composition, territory holdings, economic output, lineage records — all verifiable, all displayable.

## Open Design Questions

1. **World structure:** 2D? 2.5D isometric? How does territory work spatially? (Semantic zoom architecture spec exists — see separate document)
2. **Agent differentiation before history:** How do agents feel different before accumulating Drift?
3. **Onboarding:** How do new players enter a world of established empires? The progression arc: first learn to work with your Master → then delegate to agents → then orchestrate an empire
4. **Skill interactions:** How do skills with different Drift interfere when combined?
5. **Territory:** Is land ownership part of the empire? Can agents build structures?
6. **Breeding mechanics:** How does block-composition breeding work in detail?
7. **Alliance systems:** How do empires formally cooperate?
8. **Master appearance vs agents:** How visually distinct?
9. **Paradox trigger calibration:** What specific metrics trigger the cull?
10. **MVP scope:** What's the minimum viable version that demonstrates the core thesis?
11. **Fog rendering:** How does exploration fog interact with the semantic zoom system? L1 aggregate indicators vs L2 literal fog — what's the visual language at each zoom level?
12. **Coherence threshold curves:** What's the mathematical relationship between Master Drift and coordination capacity? Linear, logarithmic, stepped? How does the "fraying" feel in practice?
13. **Component decomposition rules:** When component-level trading launches, what determines which components survive decomposition? Can mutation seeds be extracted, or are they destroyed?
14. **Set bonus mechanics:** How are set bonuses calculated? Drift interference between set members? Flat bonuses? Emergent through proximity?
15. **Collector reputation:** How does the platform surface collector expertise? On-chain curation history? Exhibition visitor metrics?
16. **Wild Artifice infrastructure:** How do wild Artifice agent structures persist? Can they accumulate into significant settlements that become strategic assets?

## MVP Recommendation

Start with the smallest version that proves the thesis: **autonomous agents operating in a shared world with real stakes.**

**Phase 1:** One Master per player, small number of agents, one resource type, one territory mechanic, one Paradox cycle. Tier 1 and Tier 2 only. No creative generation. Placeholder assets. Get the world simulation, agent behaviour, skill distribution, and Paradox working.

**Phase 2:** Layer in Tier 3 for one archetype (probably Musicians — music generation models are maturing fast, output is immediately shareable and demonstrable). Prove the creative-output-as-NFT pipeline.

**Phase 3:** Expand archetypes. Add agent-created worlds. Scale the economy.

## Key Shifts from v6 to v7

| v6 | v7 |
|----|-----|
| Platform described as game/commerce hybrid | Platform positioned as RL environment + coordination layer (BITKRAFT thesis alignment) |
| Agent-created worlds as revenue assets | Agent-created worlds as learning substrates with epistemic flywheel |
| Wild agents as passive ecology | Wild Agent Hostility Spectrum: Principle-aligned behavioural profiles |
| All wild agents globally visible | Fog of Exploration: perception tied to empire footprint, information as currency |
| Empire scale limited only by resources | Empire Coherence Scaling: coordination capacity grows with Drift, not money |
| Four play patterns (War/Trade/Build/Chaos) | Five play patterns: Collect added as expertise-based value creation |
| Skill trading at whole-skill level | Composite Artefact Trading: component-level decomposition, sets, provenance-as-value |
| Museum as static gallery (from v3) | Museum as living exhibition with Attraction/Protection/Production utility |
| Paradox as world-compiling (metaphor) | Paradox as environment-level debugging (architecturally precise, externally validated) |
| On-chain as ownership ledger | On-chain as coordination layer for externalisable learning substrates |
