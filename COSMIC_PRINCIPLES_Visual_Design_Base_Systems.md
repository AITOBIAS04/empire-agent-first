# Cosmic Principles: Visual Design & Base Systems Review

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** DRAFT FOR REVIEW  
**Date:** January 25, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This document reviews and extends two emerging design concepts for Cosmic Principles: Tetris-style character design (geometric block-based creature aesthetics) and home base systems (Codex Home, Breeding Lab, Rift Beacon). The Tetris approach successfully bridges visual identity with mechanical systems—genealogy, mutations, Integrity states, and evolution all become visually readable. The base concepts require refinement to avoid passive income mechanics while still creating player investment and social spaces.

The core recommendation is to proceed with Tetris-style block design as a locked visual language, implementing it through a modular component system that supports production efficiency. The base systems should be simplified to purely visual/social spaces (Codex Home, Breeding Lab as observation space) while removing or heavily gating the Rift Beacon to prevent economy disruption.

## Part 1: Tetris-Style Character Design Review

### 1.1 Core Concept Validation

The decision to use geometric block-based creature design is **strategically sound** for multiple reasons:

**Thematic Alignment:** The "creatures as living code" mythology is reinforced when creatures literally appear assembled from data blocks. Every visual element reinforces the fiction—circuit traces connecting blocks, data-stream particles, compilation effects during capture. Players never forget that creatures are code.

**Production Scalability:** Creating variants, mutations, and evolution forms through palette shifts, block rearrangements, and visual effects (rather than entirely new models) dramatically reduces asset production costs. A team can create dozens of creature variants without modelling new geometry.

**Visual Readability:** Block-based design makes mechanical information instantly readable. Players can visually identify parentage, mutations, Integrity states, and evolution stages at a glance. This reduces UI dependency and creates a more immersive experience.

**Genealogy Clarity:** When breeding two creatures, players can see which "blocks" came from which parent. Mutations appear as new block configurations or colour shifts. This makes breeding decisions more informed and engaging.

### 1.2 Visual Language Specification

The principle-colour-block archetype system is **locked and approved** with minor refinements:

#### Primary Principles (Foundation Triangle)

**Order — Structure Binds Chaos**

Visual Language: Rigid, symmetrical block arrangements with clean geometric precision. Circuit lines are straight, evenly spaced, and emit a steady blue-white glow. Blocks are tightly fitted with no visible gaps. The overall impression is military-precision architecture.

Block Arrangements: Cubes and rectangular prisms arranged in mirror-symmetrical patterns. Core (body) block is central and largest. Limbs attach at precise 90-degree angles. Floating elements (if any) orbit in predictable patterns.

Signature Elements: Visible "compilation seams" where blocks join—neon blue lines that pulse gently. When stationary, Order creatures seem almost statue-like in their stillness.

**Chaos — Unpredictability Disrupts Balance**

Visual Language: Asymmetrical, jagged block configurations with irregular spacing. Circuit lines are erratic—flickering, branching unpredictably, and pulsing in red-orange gradients. Blocks appear to shift slightly even when stationary, creating unease.

Block Arrangements: Tetrahedrons, skewed cubes, and irregular polyhedrons in deliberately unbalanced compositions. No clear core-body distinction—mass seems distributed randomly. Elements drift and reorient.

Signature Elements: "Glitch sparks"—small particles that erupt from block seams randomly. When moving, Chaos creatures leave brief after-image trails that fragment and dissolve.

**Nature — Entropy Erodes Structure**

Visual Language: Flowing, organic-looking block clusters with rounded edges (beveled cubes, sphere-adjacent geometries). Circuit lines are gentle pulses in green-gold gradients that follow natural rhythms (slow inhale, slow exhale). Blocks seem grown rather than assembled.

Block Arrangements: Bulbous, seed-like forms with apparent clusters. No hard angles—connections are organic mergers. Elements respond to movement with fluid trailing effects. The overall impression is a living architecture.

Signature Elements: "Growth rings"—subtle circular patterns on block surfaces that pulse gently. Nature creatures leave brief flower-like patterns where they pause.

#### Secondary Domains (Expanded Types)

**Void — Absence Defines Form**

Visual Language: Sparse, floating block arrangements with deliberate gaps between elements. Circuit lines are dim, intermittent—dark purple to black gradients that seem to absorb light rather than emit it. Blocks appear to drift in zero-gravity.

Block Arrangements: Minimalist configurations—few blocks, maximum negative space. Elements orbit a central (often absent) point. Some blocks may be semi-transparent or contain internal void spaces.

Signature Effects: Light-absorption aura—Void creatures create subtle darkness around them. Other creatures' circuit lines dim slightly when nearby. When moving, Void creatures leave "shadow trails" that persist briefly.

**Arcane — Complexity Amplifies Power**

Visual Language: Complex, layered block arrangements with intricate internal geometries. Circuit lines are rapid, branching patterns in violet-pink gradients. Blocks seem to contain other blocks—fractal self-similarity.

Block Arrangements: Concentric configurations with visible internal structure. Blocks within blocks. Elements rotate slowly and independently. The overall impression is arcane complexity.

Signature Effects: "Mana bloom"—arcane creatures emit brief radiant bursts when using abilities. Their circuit lines leave persistent geometric patterns in the air.

**Artifice — Precision Enables Efficiency**

Visual Language: Mechanical, industrial block configurations with visible functional elements. Circuit lines are steady amber-steel gradients with occasional industrial "spark" effects. Blocks have visible joints, hinges, and connection points.

Block Arrangements: Modular configurations with clear functional separation. Body, limbs, and appendages are distinct components. Moving parts are visible and articulated. The overall impression is a machine-organism.

Signature Effects: "Industrial pulse"—mechanical heartbeat effect. Artifice creatures emit faint whirring or clicking sounds (optional, depends on audio design direction).

**Spirit — Essence Transcends Form**

Visual Language: Ethereal, translucent block arrangements with soft edges and ghosting effects. Circuit lines are gentle cyan-white gradients that seem to breathe. Blocks are semi-transparent with internal luminous cores.

Block Arrangements: Floating, apparently weightless configurations. No clear grounding point—elements drift in apparent zero-gravity. Core (if visible) is a soft luminous point rather than solid geometry.

Signature Effects: "Spirit trail"—persistent after-images that linger and fade slowly. Other creatures' circuit lines gain subtle cyan highlights when nearby Spirit creatures.

### 1.3 Block System Technical Specifications

#### Block Categories by Function

**Core Blocks (3-5 per creature):**

These are the primary body segments—the central mass that defines the creature's fundamental form. Core blocks are largest, most detailed, and least likely to change through mutation. Each principle has a signature Core Block shape:

- Order Core: Perfect cube with beveled edges
- Chaos Core: Skewed polyhedron with asymmetric facets
- Nature Core: Organic sphere-segment with visible "growth rings"
- Void Core: Hollow cube with internal void space
- Arcane Core: Nested cube fractal
- Artifice Core: Mechanical multi-part assembly
- Spirit Core: Translucent sphere with internal core

**Limb Blocks (4-8 per creature):**

These define the creature's appendages and movement capabilities. Limb blocks are more variable between individuals of the same species and more susceptible to mutation influence:

- Order Limbs: Symmetrical pairs, 90-degree attachment
- Chaos Limbs: Asymmetric placement, variable count
- Nature Limbs: Organic, flowing connections
- Void Limbs: Sparse, with floating support elements
- Arcane Limbs: Multiple segmented sections
- Artifice Limbs: Visible joints and mechanical attachments
- Spirit Limbs: Apparently weightless, trailing effects

**Decorative Blocks (5-15 per creature):**

These add visual complexity, detail, and individual variation. Decorative blocks are most affected by mutations, unstable captures, and environmental influences:

- Pattern expression blocks (species-identifying)
- Mutation markers (unstable capture indicators)
- Environmental adaptation blocks (biome-specific)
- Archetype indicators (Shark/Diplomat/Saboteur/Spy)
- Evolution stage markers (v1.0 → v2.0 → v3.0 → Apex)

**Aura/Effect Blocks (2-4 per creature):**

These are primarily visual elements that create the creature's presence and ability effects:

- Circuit node blocks (ability activation points)
- Particle emitter blocks (effect origins)
- Aura generation blocks (passive effects)

#### Performance Constraints

**Maximum Block Counts (Locked):**

| Creature Stage | Maximum Blocks | Justification |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Base Form (v1.0) | 15-25 blocks | Core identity, efficient rendering |
| Evolved Form (v2.0) | 25-35 blocks | Additional complexity, maintained performance |
| Evolved Form (v3.0) | 35-45 blocks | High complexity, requires optimization |
| Apex Form | 45-55 blocks | Maximum detail, rare encounter |
| Unstable Variant | +3-5 blocks | Mutation additions, visual distinction |

**Optimization Strategies:**

- Circuit lines are texture-based rather than geometry-based (reduces polycount)
- Block internal geometry is simplified (solid colour with texture detail)
- Particle effects are sprite-based rather than particle-system-based where possible
- Aura effects use sprite planes rather than volumetric geometry
- Draw distance considerations for dense creature clusters (e.g., Server Bank display)

### 1.4 Mechanical System Integration

#### Genealogy Visualization

**Parental Contribution Reading:**

When players view a creature, they can visually identify which blocks came from which parent:

- Parent A contributes Core Block shape and primary limb configuration
- Parent B contributes decorative block patterns and aura configuration
- Combined contributions appear in fusion zones where blocks meet

**Visual Clarity:**

Each parent contributes blocks with their principle's colour signature:

- If both parents are Order, blocks are blue-white with clear lines
- If Order parent contributes to Chaos offspring, blue-white blocks appear in asymmetric arrangements
- This creates "genetic tracing" where lineage is visually readable

**Implementation Note:**

At base evolution (v1.0), parental contribution is 50/50 block allocation. At v2.0+, offspring may inherit more blocks from one parent based on environmental conditions or breeding choices.

#### Mutation Visualization

**Unstable Capture Mutations:**

Unstable captures (caught during Red Integrity phase) gain subtle visual mutations:

- **Minor Mutation (+1 block):** One decorative block is added in non-standard position
- **Major Mutation (+2 blocks):** Two decorative blocks added, one may be different principle type
- **Variant Mutation:** One block has different colour palette from rest of creature
- **Paradox-Touched:** One block is distinctly different colour (event marker)

**Mutation Visibility:**

Mutations are visually distinct from normal variation:

- Normal variation: Same block types in slightly different positions
- Mutation: Different block types, unusual arrangements, colour anomalies

**Mutation Transmission:**

When breeding mutated creatures:

- 50% chance mutation block is inherited
- 30% chance mutation block transforms to parent principle colours
- 20% chance mutation block is lost (reverts to base creature)

#### Integrity State Visualization

**Visual Degradation Over Time:**

As a creature's Integrity drops, its visual fidelity degrades predictably:

| Integrity State | Visual Effect | Circuit Effect |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 100 (Stable) | Full visual fidelity, blocks at maximum cohesion | Steady, bright glow |
| 80-99 | Subtle edge softening, minor colour desaturation | Slight pulse irregularity |
| 60-79 | Visible block separation at seams, slight flickering | Intermittent glow patterns |
| 40-59 | Significant gap formation between blocks, frequent flickering | Erratic pulse, some segments dark |
| 20-39 (Critical) | Extreme separation, blocks visibly drifting, distortion | Most circuits dark, occasional sparks |
| 1-19 (Failing) | Active distortion, blocks warping, apparent corruption | Random segments bright, most dark |
| 0 (Collapsed) | Frozen in corrupted state, Glitched Relic | No glow, blocks frozen mid-distortion |

**Player Readability:**

The Integrity visualization is instantly readable—players can assess a creature's Integrity at a glance without checking the UI number. This creates urgency for stabilisation and makes Integrity meaningful beyond numbers.

#### Evolution Visualization

**Version Update Progression:**

Each evolution stage (v1.0 → v2.0 → v3.0 → Apex) adds blocks, refines arrangements, and intensifies circuit patterns:

| Stage | Block Change | Circuit Change | Visual Effect |
|-------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| v1.0 Base | Core + Limbs + Basic Decorative | Single-layer circuits | Clean, readable form |
| v2.0 Evolved | +2-3 Core/Limb blocks, +5-8 Decorative | Secondary circuit layer | Increased complexity |
| v3.0 Advanced | +2-3 Core/Limb blocks, +5-10 Decorative | Tertiary circuit layer | Dense, intricate form |
| Apex | +5 Core/Limb blocks, +10-15 Decorative | Full multi-layer system | Visually stunning, clearly "more compiled" |

**Evolution Clarity:**

Evolution is visually dramatic—players can immediately recognize an Apex creature as "more compiled" than a base form. This creates aspiration and progression satisfaction.

**Archetype Indication:**

Creature archetype (Shark/Diplomat/Saboteur/Spy) is visible through block arrangement and movement behaviour:

- Shark: Aggressive block angles, forward-leaning posture, "pacing" idle animation
- Diplomat: Balanced symmetrical arrangement, calm stationary pose, measured movement
- Saboteur: Unusual block placement, unpredictable idle animation, erratic movement
- Spy: Sleek minimal arrangement, "watching" idle pose, precise deliberate movement

## Part 2: Base Systems Review

### 2.1 Codex Home Concept Evaluation

**Concept:** A home space where players can see their creatures visibly existing when not deployed. Creatures display their Integrity states, Unstable copies visibly degrade, and players can interact to build affinity.

**Strengths:**

- Creates emotional investment in creatures beyond battle statistics
- Visualizes Hot Potato economy (watching Integrity decay creates urgency)
- Supports creature autonomy concepts (creatures interact with each other)
- Provides a social space for showing off rare captures

**Concerns:**

- Risk of becoming a "passive观察" mechanic that consumes play time
- May create FOMO (fear of missing out) if players feel they must watch creatures
- Technical complexity of rendering many creature instances in one space

**Refined Implementation:**

The Codex Home should be a **visit-and-Interact space**, not a "watch-and-wait" space:

- Players can enter, view their active roster, see all creatures at a glance
- Creatures have "affinity" that increases with interaction (feeding, petting, playing)
- Affinity influences Autonomy behaviours (higher affinity = creature responds more reliably)
- Creatures visually react to player presence (idle animations, greeting behaviours)
- Space supports visitor players (friends can view your Codex Home)
- No time-gated mechanics—all interactions are player-initiated

**Codex Home Layout:**

| Area | Contents | Function |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Roster Display** | Active creatures (3-5) in "living" arrangements | Quick view, interaction |
| **Gene Bank View** | All captured creatures in grid arrangement | Collection browsing |
| **Server Bank View** | Creatures in "Matrix" simulation (AFK farming) | Visual only, no interaction |
| **Affection Corner** | Interaction zone for building creature affinity | Feeding, petting, playing |
| **Visitor Area** | Space for friends to view your Codex | Social display |
| **Trophy Hall** | Glitched Relics and achievement displays | Collection pride |

**Affinity System (Optional Layer):**

Players can increase creature affinity through interaction:

- Feeding (provides small temporary Integrity boost)
- Playing (unlocks hidden interaction animations)
- Talking (creature responds with archetype-appropriate reactions)
- Grooming (removes visual degradation, provides Integrity stability)

Higher affinity creatures:
- Have brighter circuit lines
- Respond more reliably in battle (Autonomy bonus)
- Display unique idle animations
- May unlock exclusive interaction dialogue

**Design Note:** Affinity is a **quality-of-life layer**, not a progression gate. Players can ignore it entirely without losing core functionality.

### 2.2 Breeding Lab Concept Evaluation

**Concept:** A dedicated space for breeding where players can see the splice happening, monitor environmental conditions for mutations, and intervene during the process if they time it right.

**Strengths:**

- Makes breeding an active experience rather than menu clicking
- Environmental conditions become visible and interactive
- Skill expression through timing (catch breeding at the right moment)
- Visual reinforcement of "creatures as code" mythology

**Concerns:**

- Adds complexity to breeding system
- May create "optimal breeding windows" that feel mandatory
- Environmental intervention could feel like gambling

**Refined Implementation:**

The Breeding Lab should be an **observation and influence space**, not a mandatory time investment:

- Players select two parent creatures and initiate breeding
- The Lab shows the breeding pair in adjacent chambers
- Environmental conditions (Solar Flare, Network Storm, etc.) are displayed
- Players can choose to "boost" conditions (costs Cycles) or let breeding proceed naturally
- The "splice" animation shows blocks from both parents merging
- Result appears with visible parentage markers

**Environmental Influence System:**

| Condition | Natural Occurrence | Player Boost | Effect |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|--------|
| Solar Flare | Random (10% chance) | Cycle cost (50) | Chaos principle boosted, Unstable variants, Processing boost |
| Network Storm | Random (8% chance) | Cycle cost (75) | Arcane principle amplified, Enhanced abilities |
| Void Eclipse | Random (5% chance) | Cycle cost (100) | Void mutations possible, Shadow variants, Entropy resistance |
| Genesis Bloom | Random (12% chance) | Cycle cost (40) | Nature principle dominant, Regeneration traits |
| Stability Lock | Random (15% chance) | Cycle cost (30) | Order principle guaranteed, Perfect inheritance |

**Skill Expression:**

When the breeding animation is in progress, players can:
- Time a "Snapshot" action (free, once per breeding) to capture a moment
- If Snapshot is timed during a "resonance" moment (visual feedback), offspring gains bonus
- This is skill-based timing, not gambling

**Breeding Lab Layout:**

| Area | Contents | Function |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Parent Chamber A** | First parent creature display | Selection, viewing |
| **Parent Chamber B** | Second parent creature display | Selection, viewing |
| **Fusion Zone** | Central space where breeding occurs | Animation viewing |
| **Condition Monitor** | Current environmental state display | Information |
| **Boost Console** | Player interaction point for conditions | Environmental control |
| **Result Chamber** | Offspring display after breeding | Viewing, naming |

**Visual Breeding Process:**

1. Parent A and Parent B enter adjacent chambers
2. Environmental conditions are displayed (current + trending)
3. Player may boost conditions (optional, costs Cycles)
4. Fusion Zone activates—blocks from both parents begin flowing toward centre
5. Parent blocks interleave, merge, and transform
6. "Resonance moments" flash briefly (skill timing opportunity)
7. Offspring crystallizes in Result Chamber
8. Visible markers show which blocks came from which parent
9. Player names offspring and exits Lab

### 2.3 Rift Beacon Concept Evaluation

**Concept:** An installation that attracts Paradox activity to the player's base, increasing Protocol farming chances but also making the base a target for raids.

**Strengths:**

- Creates "high-risk, high-reward" decision
- Makes Paradox events feel personal and player-driven
- Creates target-rich environments for raiders
- Potential for emergent gameplay (defending base during Paradox)

**Concerns:**

- Could create passive income that undermines Hot Potato economy
- Base attacks while player is offline create frustration
- May create "tax" mentality where players feel they must enable Beacon
- Complex to implement (offline protection, attack windows, defence mechanics)

**Recommendation:** **Deprioritize or heavily gate this feature**

**Analysis:**

The Rift Beacon concept conflicts with your earlier design decisions:
- You moved guilds to P2 because social systems are complex
- You implemented daily quests as engagement rather than passive income
- Your Hot Potato economy is self-regulating—the Beacon could destabilize this

**Refined Alternative: Rift Attractor (Single Use, High Impact)**

Instead of a permanent installation, make Rift Attraction a **temporary, high-commitment action**:

- Players can activate a "Rift Focus" on their Codex (once per week)
- For the next 6 hours, Paradox events have 2x local probability
- Player receives notification when Paradox event triggers locally
- During the event, player's creatures have increased Unstable capture chance
- BUT: Activating Rift Focus broadcasts player location to raiders (increased raid targeting)

**This preserves the high-risk, high-reward tension without passive income:**

- Player chooses when to activate (strategy)
- Window is limited (no permanent advantage)
- Attack window is known (player can be online to defend)
- Trade-off is explicit (Protocol farming vs raid targeting)

**Rift Attractor Layout (if implemented):**

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Attractor Core** | Central installation, visible when active |
| **Rift Visual** | Local Paradox event indicator (particle effect) |
| **Warning Signal** | Broadcasts to raiders when active |
| **Defence Mode** | Optional defensive upgrade (increases raid defence during Attractor) |

**Implementation Recommendation:**

Pursue the Codex Home and Breeding Lab as visual/social spaces. Deprioritize the Rift Attractor—it can be added post-launch if the economy proves too stable and needs destabilization tools.

### 2.4 Base System Integration Summary

**Recommended Implementation Priority:**

| System | Priority | Scope | Justification |
|--------|----------|-------|---------------|
| Codex Home | P1 | Launch | Visualizes Hot Potato, creature affinity, social display |
| Breeding Lab | P1 | Launch | Makes breeding active, reinforces "code" mythology |
| Rift Attractor | P2 | Post-launch | Can be added later if economy needs destabilization |
| Guild Systems | P2 | Post-launch | Complex, can launch without (many successful games did) |

**Base System Philosophy:**

The base should be a **player investment space** that:
- Creates emotional attachment to creatures
- Visualizes mechanical systems (Integrity, breeding, mutations)
- Provides social interaction points (visiting friends, showing off)
- Does NOT provide passive income or time-gated progression

---

## Part 3: Fusion System (Post-Launch Consideration)

### 3.1 Concept Overview

You mentioned fusions as a post-release possibility. The block-based design makes fusion mechanically intuitive—combining two creatures literally combines their block arrangements.

### 3.2 Fusion Mechanics

**Basic Concept:**

Fusion combines two creatures into one new creature, inheriting blocks from both parents:

- Base creature (primary) contributes Core and primary configuration
- Fusion partner (secondary) contributes additional blocks and modifications
- Result inherits principle from base creature (can be changed with special items)
- Block count is additive (v2.0 + v2.0 = ~40-50 blocks)

**Fusion Requirements:**

- Both creatures must be at minimum v2.0 evolution
- Fusion consumes both parent creatures (they are destroyed)
- Costs significant Cycles (base cost + premium for higher block counts)
- Requires Fusion Catalyst item (earned from Paradox events)

**Visual Fusion Process:**

1. Both parent creatures enter Fusion Chamber
2. Blocks from both parents separate into individual units
3. Blocks interleave and merge based on principle compatibility
4. New core forms from combined elements
5. Result creature crystallizes with visible mixed heritage

### 3.3 Fusion Value Proposition

**Collector Value:**

A fusion of two rare, unstable-caught creatures would have a unique visual signature that cannot be replicated. The fusion inherits:
- Parent A's distinctive block arrangements
- Parent B's mutation markers
- Paradox-Touched indicators from both
- Combined genealogy depth

**Mechanical Value:**

Fusion creates "specialized" creatures that may excel in specific roles:
- High block count for visual impressiveness
- Combined principle effects (e.g., Order core with Chaos decorative blocks)
- Unique ability combinations from both parents

### 3.4 Implementation Considerations

**Production:**

Fusion results are procedural—the game combines block arrangements automatically. No pre-designed fusion models required.

**Balance:**

Fusion should be:
- Expensive (prevents fusion-spamming)
- Risky (consumes rare parents)
- Rewarding (unique visual result)
- Not strictly stronger than normal evolution (preserves choice value)

**Post-Launch Recommendation:**

Fusion can be introduced as a "late-game prestige" feature once the core game is established. The visual novelty and collector value make it attractive without disrupting early-game balance.

## Part 4: Production Recommendations

### 4.1 Roblox Implementation Guidelines

**Mesh and Texture Strategy:**

- Block geometry: Use basic Roblox Part objects where possible
- Circuit lines: Texture-based (decals) rather than mesh-based
- Particle effects: Sprite-based (BillboardGui) for performance
- Aura effects: Sprite planes with transparency

**Component System:**

Create a creature from modular components:
- Core Block Mesh (per principle)
- Limb Block Meshes (per archetype)
- Decorative Block Meshes (universal)
- Aura Block Meshes (universal)
- Circuit Textures (per principle)
- Colour Palettes (configurable per creature)

This allows rapid variant creation by mixing components.

**Performance Optimization:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Many creatures in Codex Home | LOD system (simplified geometry at distance) |
| Circuit line rendering | Batched draw calls, texture animation |
| Particle effects | Sprite-based, pooled instances |
| Block separation animation | Vertex shader displacement (efficient) |

### 4.2 Asset Production Priorities

**Phase 1 (Launch):**

- Core Block Meshes (7 principles × 1 shape = 7 meshes)
- Limb Block Meshes (7 principles × 2 shapes = 14 meshes)
- Decorative Blocks (10 universal shapes)
- Circuit Textures (7 principles × 3 variations = 21 textures)
- Colour Palettes (configurable per creature)
- Evolution Overlay Textures (v2.0, v3.0, Apex)

**Phase 2 (Post-Launch):**

- Additional Limb Block Meshes (variations)
- Mutation Block Meshes (unique shapes)
- Paradox-Touched Effects
- Fusion Visual Effects
- Premium Cosmetic Variants

### 4.3 Quality Assurance

**Visual Consistency Checks:**

- All creatures of same principle share colour palette
- Block arrangements follow archetype guidelines
- Evolution progression is visually clear
- Integrity degradation is readable at distance
- Mutations are visible but not overwhelming

**Mechanical Readability Tests:**

- Players can identify parentage from visual alone
- Mutations are distinguishable from normal variation
- Integrity state is readable without UI
- Evolution stage is immediately apparent
- Archetype is visible through block arrangement
